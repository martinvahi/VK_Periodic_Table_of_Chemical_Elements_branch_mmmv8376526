The core development file, the 

    ./logo_development_version.svg

has been created with Inkscape. The colors of the logo are transparent
and blue(#0044ff). The png and jpeg files have been created from the

    ./logo_of_mmmv8376526.svg

by using GIMP. The logo is in public domain from
my(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) point of view, but there has been NO checks
to find out, whether it matches with any trademarks or logos that were
created before this logo was created.
